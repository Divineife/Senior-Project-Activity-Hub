Notes of issues I faced and fix
Started this late so does not have earlier hacks

Activating virtual environment to ensure proper package installation 
    |- source venv/bin/activate ; ensure you are in the right directory
    |- source deactivate        ; for deactivation 
    |- which python             ; to see what python we are using
    |- pip install -r requirements.txt ; to install all our requirements

Creating requirements.txt
    |- pip freeze > requirements.txt 

Using imports
    |- python -m mypackage.mymodule ; to run with relative imports, run one level above folder holding script

Checking test coverage
    |- pytest --cov=my_module

Divergent branch
    |- git config pull.rebase false

formatting setup with prettier
    |- npm run format
