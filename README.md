# Senior-Project-Activity-Hub
In today's dynamic educational landscape, fostering a sense of community and engagement within academic institutions is essential. Recognizing the need for a centralized platform that connects students, faculty, and event organizers, I propose the development of the "Activity Hub" web app. This innovative platform aims to serve as a dynamic space for Universities in the Nashville area to share and discover events, enhancing the overall campus experience.
